# IEEEXtreme

## 1. What is IEEEXtreme?
[IEEEXtreme](https://ieeextreme.org/) is an online programming competition organized by the [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/) (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers). During this exciting 24-hour competition, teams of students from around the world solve algorithmic programming problems to test their skills and creativity.

## 2. Purpose of the Repository
This repository is primarily intended to house my solutions to the problems I have addressed to the IEEEXtreme problems I have participated in. It is also intended to serve as a resource for those who wish to study and prepare for the competition. Feel free to review the solutions, make suggestions, and contribute your own solutions.

## 3. My participation in IEEEXtreme
I have participated in the next edition of IEEEXtreme:

- [IEEEXtreme 16.0](IEEEXtreme%2016.0/README.md) (2022)
